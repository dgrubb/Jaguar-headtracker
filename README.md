# Jaguar-headtracker

This project is envisioned to provide motion-tracking controller input for the Atari Jaguar console. It is forked from the project [open-headtracker](https://code.google.com/archive/p/open-headtracker/) which provided head tracking based control for radio controlled model aircraft. In this case, output shall be expanded to provide Jaguar-compatible signaling so motion can be used for Jaguar games.
